# GLPGDSBA_Dec21_Hackathon
I recently participated in the Shinkansen Travel Experience - Hackathon organized by Great Learning for PG-DSBA course attendees. This is my experience with the Hackathon. It was an exciting two days event and enormous learning opportunity for like minded Machine Learning enthusiasts .
## Below is the Problem Description 
This is the problem of a Shinkansen (Bullet-Trains) of Japan. They aim to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to the passenger travel experience. Provided is a random sample of individuals who travelled using their train. The on-time performance of the trains along with the passenger’s information is published in the CSV file named ‘Traveldata_train’.  These passengers were later asked to provide their feedback on various parameters related to the travel along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report CSV labelled ‘Surveydata_train’.

In the survey, a passenger was explicitly asked whether they were delighted with their overall travel experience and that is captured in the data of the survey report under the variable labelled ‘Overall_Experience’. 

The objective of this exercise is to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback towards a positive scale. You are provided test data containing Travel data and Survey data of passengers. Both the test data and the train data are collected at the same time and belongs to the same company.
### Goal:
The goal of the problem is to predict whether a passenger was delighted considering his/her overall travel experience of traveling in Shinkansen (Bullet Train). For each passenger id in the test set, you must predict the “Overall_Experience” level.

### Dataset

The problem consists of 2 separate datasets: Travel data & Survey data. The Travel data has information related to passengers and the performance of the Train in which they traveled. The survey data is the aggregated data of surveys collected post-service experience. You are expected to treat both the datasets as raw data and perform any necessary cleaning/validation steps as required.

## MY Approach

Converting a business problem statement into Machine Learning Problem statement is the most critical factor in success of Data Science initiatives. To be able to do that we need to be thorough with the data. I solved the problem with Python. So first step was to import and understand the data.
